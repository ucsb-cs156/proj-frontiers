        <ul>
          <li>
            Assist students and instructors in working with a GitHub
            organization associated with a course. In this role, it is similar

          </li>
          <li>
            Provide a platform for the Frontiers project, an NSF-sponsored
            project to develop metrics to asssess learning of fundamental
            Software Engineering Skills.

                Our development team is working on the following features to
                support the Frontiers project
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Instructors will be able to define rubrics to evaluate four
                  types of GitHub artifacts: Commits, Issues, Pull Requests, and
                  Code Reviews
                </li>
                <li>
                  Instructors will be able to define collections of these
                  artifacts that are either fixed collections, or random samples
                  over defined criteria (such as repo(s), user(s), teams(s),
                  date ranges, etc.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Instructors will be able to assign students and staff to
                  evaluate artifacts according to the rubrics.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Instructors will be able to calculate interrater reliability
                  using metrics such as Cohen's Kappa and Kronbach's Alpha to
                  determine whether students are applying the rubric in a way
                  that is consistent with experts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Instructors will be able to see the results of these
                  evaluations, download them as CSV files, and use this in
                  assigning both grades for formative and summative assessment
                  of whether students have learned to produce Github artifacs of
                  high quality.
