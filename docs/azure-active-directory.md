## Note for UCSB CS156 Students

**If you are a student in CS156, setting up Azure is not required of you** 

* This is not part of the course, or a part of Frontiers you will be required to work on.
* This is in the code base to support faculty and students at Oregon State University, and other universities that use Microsoft as their main OAuth provider rather than Google.
* When you configure the app without setting up `MICROSOFT=true`, the parts of the code that deal with Microsoft Azure are disabled.

## Azure Active Directory

Azure Active Directory (also known as Entra ID) is a service offered by Microsoft Azure that allows users to sign on with their Active Directory accounts. These accounts reside in an Active Directory "tenant". 

The tenant stores all of the account information, and is identified by a Tenant ID.

In order to use Active Directory as a sign-on, the following steps need to be taken:

# Setup on localhost

1. Sign up for an Azure account.

   * <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/azure-portal>

   This may require a credit card, as Azure will use it to identify that you are a real person, and will reverse the charge shortly after.

   Currently, it is not possible to use your UCSB Account.

   From the hamburger menu on the left, Select Entra ID

3.  Select App Registrations

    It might also be at the bottom of the page and look like this:

4.  Select New Registration

5.  Fill in a name, and select "Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant)"

    <img width="1378" height="976" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fb52c95-b655-4b1f-9a3a-425adb919c04" />

6.  Then, fill in a Redirect URI:
    ```web
    http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/azure-dev
    ```
    Select web as the platform.

7.  Click create.

8.  From this next screen, for running on localhost, copy your Application ID and Directory (tenant) ID to their places in `.env` respectively:

    ```env
    MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id>
    MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
    ```

9.  Next, let's add a client secret. Select "Add a certificate or secret", then select "New Client Secret".

    Give it a name and an expiry date. Click add, and copy the value to its respective place in .env:
    
    ```env
    MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret>
    ```

# Setup on dokku


1.  Add at least one more Redirect URI. Select "Authentication"

    <img width="200" height="420" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee62bce6-4bb8-4ba1-aa8c-407d503227b5" />

    Then, from "Web" select "Add URI".

2.  Add your dokku installation with the following URI, substituting `<appname>` and `<dokku-number>` as needed:
   
    ```web
    https://<appname>.dokku-<dokku-number>.cs.ucsb.edu/login/oauth2/code/azure-dev
    ```

    Click "Save" at the bottom.

# Running with this setup. 

For localhost:
  * Place `MICROSOFT=true` at the beginning of the spring boot run command, like so:

    ```
    MICROSOFT=true mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

For dokku:
  * Add `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID`, and `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` as config variables (`dokku config:set ...`)
  * Additionally, do:
    ```bash
    dokku config:set --no-restart <appname> MICROSOFT=true
    ```
  * Rebuild with: `dokku ps:rebuild <appname>`

The setup is now complete!

## Implementation Notes

When Microsoft issues OIDC tokens, they are listed with the issuer including the AD Tenant ID. 

Since this changes depending on the organization, other Active Directory tenants (ie Oregon State or Chico State)
have different Tenant IDs. 

As a result, when they try to sign in, they are listed as being issued by those tenants. 

Spring Security, by default, does not allow this, and so `SecurityConfig.java` includes a custom validator for the tokens
that checks the result of the url, and ensures the only difference is the tenant ID. 

Additionally, since Microsoft requires you to use your own tenant ID as the issuer url, most of the OIDC endpoints are manually set in `application-microsoft.properties`.
